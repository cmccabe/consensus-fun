consensus-fun

This is a sample implementation of some distributed consensus protocols.

Currently implemented:
* Two-phase commit
* Paxos

In both of these tests, the nodes vote on which node should be the "leader" of
the cluster.  Nodes are represented by operating system threads.  One node
sending a message to another node is represented by putting the message into a
queue and posting a semaphore.

Nodes can send messages with a delay value.  This means that the messages will
be delivered after a timeout period has elapsed.  For example, a node could
send a delayed message to itself in order to implement a timeout.  Nodes can
also put delays on messages they send to other nodes in order to stress-test
the implementation a bit.

TODO:
* stress-test implementation by injecting message delays
* model and test node failure for Paxos
